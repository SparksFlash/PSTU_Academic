## This is much more than you need, and it doesn’t have any weather information. Yet these two
 tables, WEATHER and LOCATION, have a column in common: City. You can therefore put the
 information from the two tables together by joining them. You merely use the where clause to tell
 Oracle what the two tables have in common:


SELECT weather.city,condition,temperature,longitude,eastwest,latitude,northsouth
           FROM weather, location
           WHERE weather.city = location.city;

 VIEW : A view provides a way of hiding
 the logic that created the joined table just displayed

    CREATE VIEW invasion AS

           FROM weather, location
